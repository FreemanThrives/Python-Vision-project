# Python-Vision-project
This project uses the mainly the open-cv python library for vision
when the code runs, it uses the difault webcam an your pc as its eye to visualize 
The project serves two purpose:
One for color identification and the other for security purposes(used as cctv)
for color identification, when the code runs, it creats trackbars which can adjusted such that, only some colors can 
be seen in the 'mask' window and shows that picture as white in the RES window and the other pictures as black
in terms of security, when the code is running, you can click on 'q' on your keyboard to take quick snapshot which can be used as evidence.
When you finish with what you are doing, just hold on to 'c' for about three seconds to terminate the code.
